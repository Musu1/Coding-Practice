# Question-1

HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

- Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100 .
- Any less than 40 is a failing grade.

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

- If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3 , round upgrade to the next multiple of 5.
- If the value of grade is less than 38 , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.


For example,grade=84 will be rounded to 85 but 29 will not be rounded to 30 because the rounding would result in a number that is less than 40 .

Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process. For each grade, round it according to the rules above and print the result on a new line.

**Input Format**

- The first line contains a single integer denoting (the number of students).
- Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a single integer,gradei , denoting student i's grade.

**Constraints**

- 1<=n<=60
- 0<=gradei<=100

**Output Format**

For each gradei of the n grades, print the rounded grade on a new line.
